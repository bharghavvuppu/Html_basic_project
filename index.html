    <h3>House Blend Coffee</h3>
    <img src="/images/coffee3.jpg" width="300" alt="">
    <p>Coffee is consumed worldwide – the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many
    different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different
    from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and
    strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences
    between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting
    coffee.</p>

    <p>French (alt. Turkish, Dark, Espresso) is the name applied to a degree of roast of coffee beans resulting in a dark brown
    coffee bean. In this roast, the beans are well into the second crack. French roasted beans will have a dark brown color
    and a shiney surface from its oils. Coffee brewed from French roasted beans will have the natural characteristic flavors
    of the bean muted, particularly any acidic notes. Bittersweet tones from the roast will dominate the flavor. French
    roast coffees are prevalent in coffee associated with the American West. This roast profile is also commonly used in
    American espresso</p>

    <p>Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the world; the plants thrive under the shade of banana
    trees in the tropical climate. Because of Colombia’s high altitude, it also shapes the way the bean grows.
    In short, yes, the unique flavors and strong aroma make Colombian coffee a fan favorite. So what makes it so special and
    desirable? When we talk about coffee from specific locations, we typically discuss a traditional method of brewing or
    roasting. Coffee culture is unique across the number of countries that love coffee all over the world. With Colombian
    coffee, we aren’t necessarily talking about a method of brewing or roasting, but how the bean is grown.</p>
