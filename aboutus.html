    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee of various types, e.g. espresso,
    latte, and cappuccino. Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee, iced tea, and other non-caffeinated
    beverages. In continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks,
    sandwiches, muffins, fruit, or pastries. Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational
    corporations. Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various
    countries around the world.
    
    While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term "café" generally refers to a diner, British café (colloquially called a
    "caff"), "greasy spoon" (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room, or other casual
    eating and drinking place.[1][2][3][4][5] A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or
    restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. Many coffeehouses in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant
    districts in the Western world offer shisha (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic, Greek and Turkish), flavored
    tobacco smoked through a hookah. An espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and
    espresso-based drinks.</p>
